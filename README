Howdy, and welcome to the parallel fourier transform sources.

Notes about the old implementations/algorithms are kept in NOTES

If you want to know how to get access to the repository, go to
http://github.com/ and create an account. Once that's done, send an email to
Trever Fischer <tdf11@uakron.edu> with your github account name. He'll add it
to the list of contributors and you can start pushing commits.

To start with git, run:

    git clone git@github.com:workman161/fourier.git

This'll make a clone of the git repository. At this point, your repository is
totally independent of the github one. Any changes you make must later be
pushed to the 'origin' repository. After you make some changes, run:

    git add <files>

This stages your changes for adding to the next commit. This lets you do some
fancy things, but thats outside the scope of this tutorial. After all your
changes are staged, you now commit it:

    git commit -m "<commit message>"

Without the -m option and message, git starts up $EDITOR and lets you write
a much more detailed message. You can make as many commits as you want. They
all stay in your local repository. Once you get reconnected to the network,
you can push those commits to the main repository with this:

    git push

Its really easy once you get the hang of it. For more tips or how to use the
gui in windows, ask Trever Fischer <tdf11@uakron.edu> and he'll be happy to
explain more than you need to know.
